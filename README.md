# R4GT
R script to download data from google trends.

To use a version of this script you will need to have an account for Google and you will need to log on to the Google Trends site.

The script is very simple, it just sends requests to your browser to open a new tab and download data corresponding to a specific search query. These requests only work if you are logged on to Google.
